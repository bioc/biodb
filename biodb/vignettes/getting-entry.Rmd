# Accessing database entries by accession number

In this vignette, we will explain how to download and access entry information from databases.

First you need to create an instance of the `Biodb` class:
```{r}
# Create a Biodb instance
mybiodb <- biodb::Biodb$new()
```

Then you need to choose the database you want to access. For that you need to use a database ID in the form of a string. To get the list of available database IDs, just run:
```{r}
print(mybiodb$getDbsInfo()$getIds())
```

Here's how to obtain an entry, knowing its accession number:
```{r}
# Request the entry 2528 in ChEBI
entry <- mybiodb$getFactory()$getEntry('chebi', id = '2528')
```

```{r}
print(entry$getFieldValue('accession'))
```
