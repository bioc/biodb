# Architecture of biodb

The architecture is organised around the following classes:

 * The central `Biodb` class.
 * The singleton classes, attached to the `Biodb` class.
 * The connection classes `*Conn`, responsible for connecting to databases.
 * The entry classes `*Entry`, representing entries of the different databases.
 * The observer classes.

You will find below a UML class diagram, helpful to visualise all classes and their relationships.

## BiodbObject and ChildObject

All classes in *biodb* inherit directly on indirectly from the `BiodbObject` class, at the exception of `UrlRequestScheduler` and the observer classes.

The `BiodbObject` class contains mainly useful methods for:

 * Sending messages.
 * Assertions.
 * Declaring methods as abstract in sub-classes.
 * Declaring methods as deprecated in sub-classes.

The `ChildObject` class defines a `parent` field, allowing a class that inherits from it to be the child of another a class.

## Biodb

The class (`Biodb`) is the central point of the *biodb* package. To use the *biodb* package, an instance of this class `Biodb` has to be created. You can created as many instances as you want at the same time, though there would not be much purpose; all instances will be independent of each other.

From the instance of the class `Biodb`, you can access all singleton classes.

## The singleton classes

There are 5 singleton classes, each having each a distinct purpose:

 * `BiodbConfig` is meant for managing all configuration information.
 * `BiodbDbsInfo` stores database information.
 * `BiodbEntryFields` stores entry fields information.
 * `BiodbFactory` is responsible for instantiating connection and entry classes.
 * `BiodbCache` handles the cache system.

## The connection classes

## The entry classes

## The URL request scheduler
